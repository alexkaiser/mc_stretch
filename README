Follow these steps to get started quickly with the included examples. 


 - Place generic C code to evaluate the log of the probability density function (pdf) you would like to sample in ``pdf.h.'' 

 - Pick one of the included examples in "stretch_move_main.c" to run. Check that parameters in the example match your problem, which usually means setting the correct dimension.

 - Type "make" on the command line to build the code with the included makefile. 

 - Type "./stretch_move_main" to run the executable. The code will prompt to select an OpenCL implementation and hardware, then run the sampler.
